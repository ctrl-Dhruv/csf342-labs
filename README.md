# CS F342 – Computer Architecture Labs

This repository is used for **all labs** in the course.
You will work in a **single GitHub Codespace** throughout the semester.

## Structure
- `labs/` – individual lab folders (added incrementally)
- `scripts/` – common tooling (compile/run/svg)
- `artefacts/` – generated outputs (SVGs are committed)

New labs will be released by the instructor and pulled into this repository.
